## [Task 2]


### (Writing. Non-Coding)

Choose one of the following topics and write briefly about it.

```bash
The difference between using Ionic and ReactNative for mobile development. Which one do you prefer and why?
```

#### Ionic 2

```bash

1- Fast development-testing cycle.
2- It cross-compiles to iOS and Android.
3- Ionic is easy to learn & work with.
4- You can write code in TypeScript, which makes it easy if you’re coming from a background of AngularJS 2.
5- You can use TypeScript to develop applications for all platforms.
6- You can access the native functionalities of your user’s devices with the plugin system.
Angular itself is easier to learn & work with, for smaller projects than React.

```

#### React Native

```bash
1- Ionic apps enable developers with both cross-platform deployment and deployment to the mobile web as a Progressive Web App with the same code.
2-You can use the same code-base to develop applications for Android, iOS, Windows Phone. Better performance than Ionic 2, since the processing of hardware functionalities, are by the specific platform, and not Cordova.
3- React is easier to maintain if you have large projects since it follows stricter design patterns and paradigms.
4- React Native is more stable and feels like a native app.
```

#### Ionic 2 and React Native both are meant for the same purpose but different project requirements. If you are looking for performance, responsiveness and want a natively rendering app, there’s no doubt React Native is the one for you. On the other hand, if you are low on time, budget and looking for support of Native Browser apps and fine with compromising performance, then go with Ionic 2.
